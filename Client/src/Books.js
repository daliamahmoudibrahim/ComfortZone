        'Portraying himself as a failure, the protagonist of Osamu Dazai`s No Longer Human narrates a seemingly normal life even while he feels himself incapable of understanding human beings. Oba Yozo`s attempts to reconcile himself to the world around him begin in early childhood, continue through high school, where he becomes a "clown" to mask his alienation, and eventually lead to a failed suicide attempt as an adult. Without sentimentality, he records the casual cruelties of life and its fleeting moments of human connection and tenderness',

She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up―she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true.',
